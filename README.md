# Moments

he moments function calculates the first four statistical moments—mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis—for a set of time series data. The input R is a matrix where each column represents a different random variable (e.g., asset returns), and each row is an observation in time. If the input is oriented incorrectly (more columns than rows), it transposes it to ensure consistency. The function then computes the mean (central tendency), standard deviation (volatility), skewness (asymmetry), and kurtosis (tail heaviness) for each variable. Skewness and kurtosis are normalized by the standard deviation to make them dimensionless, providing standardized measures of distribution shape. The output is a matrix where each row corresponds to a variable and each column to one of the four moments.
